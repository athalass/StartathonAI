🎓 Startathon AI: Facilitator & League Toolkit
Empowering the Next Generation of AI-First Founders
Welcome to the Startathon AI League implementation guide. This toolkit is designed to help academic leaders, department chairs, and student organizers launch a high-impact AI entrepreneurship competition at their institution with minimal overhead.
📌 Overview
Startathon AI is not just a hackathon; it is a validated pedagogical framework that teaches students to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as co-founders. By participating in the Maryland Community College AI League (MCCAIL), your institution joins a statewide network focused on "Series A Readiness" and workforce innovation.

🚀 The 4-Step Implementation Path
1. Institutional Alignment (Weeks 1-2)
•	Goal: Identify a Faculty Lead and secure "Capstone" or "Lab" credit status for participants.
•	Key Asset: Partnership Proposal Template.
2. Recruitment & Training (Weeks 3-8)
•	Goal: Form multidisciplinary teams (Code, Business, Design).
•	Activity: Deploy the weekly masterclasses found in the /Presenters folder.
•	The "No-Edit" Rule: Introduce the core constraint: Business plans must be generated and refined via prompts, not manual typing.
3. Local Campus Qualifier (Week 12)
•	Goal: Crown a local champion to represent your college in the State Finals.
•	Activity: Use the Judging Rubric to ensure parity with the statewide league standards.
4. The Maryland AI Cup (Week 15)
•	Goal: The top 2 teams from your campus advance to the Annapolis-based finale to pitch to VCs and state leaders.

⚖️ Governance & Rules
To maintain the integrity of the league, all facilitators must enforce the Startathon AI "Prompt-Only" Protocol:
1.	Teams must test at least 5 different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini Pro).
2.	All business plan refinements must be documented in a Prompt Sequence Log.
3.	Direct manual editing of the AI output is prohibited (emphasizing the skill of AI Orchestration).
