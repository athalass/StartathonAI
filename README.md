# StartathonAI
"StartathonAI: The AI-Powered Startup" is an intensive, multi-day hybrid event designed to immerse participants in the practical application of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), for real-world entrepreneurship. Our goal is to inspire and support the next generation of founders.

Here's a breakdown of how you could describe it based on the documents:

Core Concept:
- It's an "AI-Powered Startup: The Best Business Plan" Startathon (a blend of a startup marathon and a hackathon) where the primary goal is to teach and challenge participants to use prompt engineering to instruct LLMs to generate comprehensive and compelling business plans for a novel startup idea.    
- Participants are not just passively learning; they are actively designing prompts, guiding AI, and creating market-ready solutions.    

Educational Focus & Skill Development:
- The event provides structured training on Day 1 covering LLMs, prompt engineering (introductory and advanced), entrepreneurship fundamentals, business plan creation, and market analysis concepts.    
- It aims to help participants develop skills in entrepreneurship, AI (specifically LLM interaction and prompt design), strategic thinking, and collaboration.    
- A key learning objective is for teams to experiment with different prompt structures and techniques (e.g., few-shot learning, role-playing, Chain of Thought).    

Competition & Challenge:
- Teams are given a specific problem: to develop a business plan for an app in a defined industry (e.g., agriculture or fishing) and geographic region (e.g., Chesapeake), with set capital constraints across three phases.    
- The core challenge is to design effective prompts that guide an LLM to produce a high-quality, implementable business plan. Teams must also provide their prompt sequences and a rationale for their chosen LLM after testing at least five models.    
- While LLMs generate the plan, teams can only refine it through follow-up prompts, not direct edits, emphasizing the skill of AI guidance.    
- The competition culminates in teams preparing and delivering a short (3-minute max) pitch for their startup idea and business plan, also using an LLM for pitch creation.    

Structure & Support:
- It's typically a 4-day hybrid event, with initial training and rules dissemination, followed by competition days, and concluding with a pitch competition.    
- A mixed team of professionals (VC, tech, business, marketing, etc.) runs the event, providing training, guidance (daily check-ins), and judging.  This expert involvement ensures participants receive insights on what makes a business plan realistic and compelling from various industry perspectives.   
- Participants have access to resources like market research reports and industry statistics to inform their work.    
- Discord is used for submissions and Q&A, facilitating communication and support.    

Outcome & Evaluation:
- Deliverables include the AI-generated Business Plan, the Prompts used, a "Thought process document" (detailing LLM selection and prompt strategy), and the Pitch.    
- A detailed evaluation rubric is used, with significant weight on the "Best Prompt" (30%) and "LLM Model Selection" (20%), underscoring the focus on mastering AI interaction. Other criteria include the creativity of the idea, implementability, the quality of the business plan itself, and the pitch effectiveness.    
- The event aims to foster innovation, help participants solve real-world challenges, and potentially turn startup dreams into reality, with an award ceremony recognizing the winners.    

In essence, "StartathonAI" is an educational and competitive experience that uniquely bridges the gap between AI technology and practical business creation, equipping participants with the skills to leverage LLMs effectively in an entrepreneurial context, all under the guidance of experienced industry professionals.
