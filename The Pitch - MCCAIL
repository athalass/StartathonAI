PROPOSAL: The Maryland Community College AI League (MCCAIL)
Subject: Scaling Student Innovation: A Partnership for the Semester-Long Startathon AI League
1. The Vision
To transform Maryland’s community colleges into a primary engine for AI-driven entrepreneurship. By transitioning the successful Startathon AI model from a single-weekend event into a semester-long collegiate league, we can move students beyond simple ideation and toward the creation of functional, "fundable" prototypes.
2. The League Structure (The "Season")
We propose a synchronized 15-week schedule that integrates into existing IT or Business curricula:
•	Weeks 1–4: Recruitment & Ideation. Local campuses form multidisciplinary teams.
•	Weeks 5–10: The Build Phase. Guided by a shared virtual masterclass series (The AI Academy) featuring guest experts from the Google Developer Group (GDG).
•	Week 12: Campus Qualifiers. Individual colleges host a "Mini-Startathon" to crown their local champions.
•	Week 15: The Maryland AI Cup. A high-profile statewide finale held in the Annapolis area, where top teams pitch to investors and state policy leaders.
3. What We Provide (The "Franchise-in-a-Box")
To minimize the administrative burden on your faculty, Anne Arundel Community College (AACC) and the FoundryPad non-profit will provide:
•	The AI Toolkit: Access to specialized prompt engineering guides and low-code AI development templates.
•	Shared Mentorship: A pool of industry coaches from GDG Annapolis and GDG Baltimore.
•	The Scoring System: A standardized rubric focusing on the "Three I’s": Idea, Implementation, and Impact.
•	The Funding Bridge: Winners gain direct access to the FoundryPad Cultivator, including potential for initial funding (SAFEs) and mentorship to reach Series A readiness.
4. Benefits to Your Institution
•	Workforce Alignment: Directly aligns with Maryland's Equitech Growth goals by training students in Generative AI and agentic workflows.
•	Grant Opportunities: Strengthens joint applications for state and federal workforce development grants.
•	Student Success: Provides a high-impact, portfolio-building experience that differentiates your graduates in the job market.
5. Proposed Next Steps
I would like to invite you to a 20-minute Dean’s Roundtable call next Thursday to discuss how we can pilot this league across our respective campuses this coming fall.
