Questionnaire:

The Role
•	Primary Identity: "Which role best describes you?" (Developer/Coder, Business/Strategy, Design/UX, or Domain Expert, other).
•	Secondary Skills: "Select 2 other areas you are comfortable contributing to." (Developer/Coder, Business/Strategy, Design/UX, or Domain Expert, other)
•	AI Comfort Level: "On a scale of 1-5, how experienced are you with Prompt Engineering or LLM orchestration?"

The Topic
•	Vertical Interest: "Which industries excite you most? (e.g., Sustainability, FinTech, Ecology, Agriculture)."
•	Problem Statement (Open Ended): "In one sentence, what is a problem you've always wanted to solve with AI?"

Work Style
•	Operating Speed: "Do you prefer to 'Move fast and break things' or 'Measure twice, cut once'?"
•	Social Energy: "Are you a natural 'Pitcher/Presenter' or do you prefer 'Behind-the-scenes building'?"
•	Commitment Level: "Are you here primarily to: Learn/Network, Win the Competition, or Start a real company?" (Mixing someone who wants a "real company" with someone just "learning" is a recipe for conflict).


The Prompt
"Act as a veteran Startup Incubator Director. I will provide a list of participants with their skills, interests, and working styles.
Goal: Form balanced teams with 2 to 5 members. Constraints: > 1. Each team MUST have 1 Hacker, 1 Hustler, and 1 Hipster. 2. Each team MUST have at least one person with 'High' AI experience. 3. Group people with similar 'Vertical Interests' but differing 'Operating Speeds' to ensure healthy friction.
Output the teams in a table, including a brief rationale about the  'Reason for Matching' for each group."
